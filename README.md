## Description of project
This is a basic website developped by me in colaboration with another developer as part of a team assignment from a university course, Web and Database Technology from TU Delft.

The main goal of this project was to show a basic level of understanding core concepts of web development and ability to use HTML and CSS for a web page's front end development.

This project represents an e-commerce webbsite without functionality.

It represents the very first project I have ever worked on as well as the starting point of my developper career.
